<p>The field of data analytics includes techniques, algorithms and tools for the inspection of data collections in order to extract patterns, generalizations and other useful information. The success and effectiveness of such analysis depend on numerous challenges related to the data itself, the nature of the analytics tasks, as well as the computing environment over which the analysis is performed. These issues have given rise to many diverse programming models, execution engines and data stores to enable large-scale data management. While all these systems have had great success, they still showcase their advantages on a limited subset of applications and types of data: For instance, graph-processing engines limit the amount of freedom in the computation at each node (or part of a graph) and fail to fully exploit possible parallelism. In addition, modern analytics workflows are tremendously complex: Data sources are heterogeneous and distributed. The tasks may be long- or short-running and entail different execution details depending on the user role and expertise. Furthermore, such tasks may range from simple or complex data operations and queries, to algorithmic processing, like data mining, text retrieval, data annotation, etc. Finally, the analysis may require multiple query engines. To harvest the benefits of this plethora of data and compute engines as well as programming models, libraries and tools available, we need coordinated, adaptive and integrative efforts on collectively tapping their potential. This central goal is the focus of this workshop. These efforts include the definition of versatile programming models, engine performance modeling and monitoring, extended planning and optimization algorithms, deployment/execution on multiple engines, as well as workflow management and visualization techniques, for complex analytics queries over large, heterogeneous, irregular or unstructured data over diverse compute environments.</p>

<p>The goal of the 1st International Workshop on Multi Engine Data Analytics (MEDAL) is to bring together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to explore, discuss and possibly redefine the state of the art in big data analytics relative to modeling, methods and tools applied over any part of algorithms and computing infrastructures, as well as use-cases and applications that relate to big data analytics over multi-engine environments. Concretely, the workshop is expected to provide insight into:</p>

<ul>
<li>Modeling of analytics processes: new models and languages to program, represent and execute complex tasks</li>
<li>Execution of analytics processes: planning, optimizing and executing complex or multiple workflows especially on dynamic multi-engine and elastic environments</li>
<li>Tools for advanced analytics tasks: theoretical and practical development of analytics tasks and operators for regular and irregular computations</li>
<li>Visualization of analytics tasks: adaptive, user-friendly and diverse representation of real-time and batch tasks executing over single or multiple runtimes</li>

</ul>

<p>This workshop will solicit original research work on fundamental aspects of big data analytics as well as the design, implementation and evaluation of novel tools, methods and applications for optimizing big data workflows (in parts or as a whole).

<h4>Keynote 1</h4>
<b>Big Data Management and Scalable Data Science: Key Challenges and (Some) Solutions</b><br/>

Prof. Dr. Volker Markl<br/>
<br/>
<b>Abstract:</b><br/>The shortage of qualified data scientists is effectively limiting Big Data from fully realizing its potential to deliver insight and provide value for scientists, business analysts, and society as a whole. Data science draws on a broad number of advanced concepts from the mathematical, statistical, and computer sciences in addition to requiring knowledge in an application domain. Solely teaching these diverse skills will not enable us to on a broad scale exploit the power of predictive and prescriptive models for huge, heterogeneous, and high-velocity data. Instead, we will have to simplify the tasks a data scientist needs to perform, bringing technology to the rescue: for example, by developing novel ways for the specification, automatic parallelization, optimization, and efficient execution of deep data analysis workflows. This will require us to integrate concepts from data management systems, scalable processing, and machine learning, in order to build widely usable and scalable data analysis systems. In this talk, I will present some of our research results towards this goal, including the Apache Flink open-source big data analytics system, concepts for the scalable processing of iterative data analysis programs, and ideas on enabling optimistic fault tolerance.<br/>

<h4>Keynote 2</h4>
<b>Enabling Cross-Platform Applications with Rheem</b><br/>
Dr. Jorge Quiane-Ruiz<br/><br/>
<b>Abstract:</b><br/>
The world is fast moving towards a data-driven society where data is the most valuable asset. Organizations need to perform very diverse analytic tasks using various data processing platforms. In doing so, they face many challenges; mainly, platform dependence, poor interoperability, and poor performance when using multiple platforms. In this talk, I will present Rheem, our vision for big data analytics over diverse data processing platforms. Rheem provides a three-layer data processing and storage abstraction to achieve both platform independence and interoperability across multiple platforms. I will discuss how Rheem allows for cross-platform applications. In particular, I will present a machine learning and a data cleaning application and show how applications can leverage the platform-independence and cross-platform execution features of Rheem to boost performance. I will conclude with a discussion on the multiple research challenges that we need to address to achieve our vision.
